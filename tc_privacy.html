      <h2> Welcome to our INR500.com </h2>
      <p>By using our app, you agree to the following terms and conditions:

        1. Our app is a platform that matches requests made by users. We do not participate in any financial
        transactions
        or take responsibility for any issues that arise from these transactions.
        2. Our app is available for use in India only. By using our app, you confirm that you are a resident of India.
        3. You are responsible for creating and maintaining a user account with us. You agree to provide accurate and
        complete information when creating your account and to keep your account information up-to-date.
        4. We do not guarantee that you will be matched with a request, or that any request you submit will be matched.
        We
        are not responsible for any losses or damages that may arise from the failure to match a request.
        5. We do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information provided by users on our app. You agree
        to
        use our app at your own risk and to verify any information provided by other users before relying on it.
        6. You are responsible for your own conduct while using our app. You agree to comply with all applicable laws,
        regulations, and our community guidelines.
        7. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time, without notice or liability, if we
        believe that you have violated these terms and conditions, or for any other reason.
        8. Our app is provided "as is" and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including but
        not
        limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
        9. We reserve the right to modify these terms and conditions at any time, without notice. Your continued use of
        our app after any such changes indicates your acceptance of the new terms and conditions.</p>

      <h2> Refund Policy:</h2>

      <p>We do not provide any refunds or guarantees for our app. You are responsible for any financial transactions
        that
        you enter into while using our app. If you encounter any issues with a transaction, you should contact the
        relevant parties involved to resolve the issue. We are not responsible for any losses or damages that may arise
        from these transactions.</p>

      <h2> Guarantee on User Accounts:</h2>

      <p>We guarantee that all user accounts on our app are genuine and not fake. We take measures to verify user
        accounts
        to ensure the authenticity of our user base. If you believe that a user account is fake or fraudulent, please
        contact us immediately so that we can investigate the matter. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any
        user account that we believe to be fake or fraudulent.</p>

      <h2> Terms & Conditions</h2>

      <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
        that
        you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app,
        or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also
        shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the
        trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to
        Ambivert Technologies Private Limited.</p>

      Ambivert Technologies Private Limited is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as
      possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
      time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you
      exactly what you’re paying for.</p>

      <p>The INR500.com website stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service.
        It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not
        jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by
        the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
        programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the INR500.com website won’t work
        properly or at all.</p>

      <p>The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.

        Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app

        - [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/terms)
        - [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics)
        - [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics)

        You should be aware that there are certain things that Ambivert Technologies Private Limited will not take
        responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
        connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Ambivert Technologies Private Limited
        cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and
        you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with
        your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the
        cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using
        the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app
        outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the
        bill
        payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received
        permission from the bill payer for using the app.

        Along the same lines, Ambivert Technologies Private Limited cannot always take responsibility for the way you
        use
        the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn
        it on to avail the Service, Ambivert Technologies Private Limited cannot accept responsibility.

        With respect to Ambivert Technologies Private Limited’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re
        using
        the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at
        all
        times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you.
        Ambivert
        Technologies Private Limited accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result
        of
        relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements
        for the both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may
        change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Ambivert Technologies Private
        Limited does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
        Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to
        the
        application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any
        time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
        delete it from your device.</p>

      We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically
      for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.
